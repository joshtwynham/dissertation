Twynumbre: I want to tell you a story about when I was a young Mage like yourself.
Twynumbre: Please follow me.
~PROLOGUE
Twynumbre: It begins during my first year at Mage school.
Twynumbre: During Alchemy, where we mainly crafted potions
Twynumbre: I found it particularly difficult to attain the same results as my peers.
Twynumbre: This led to me getting extremely angry and smashing my half finished potions.
Twynumbre: This happened far more often than I would like to admit…
Twynumbre: But I started to notice a pattern.
Twynumbre: Just before I would get this feeling of anger
Twynumbre: the same thoughts popped into my head every time.
Twynumbre: Thoughts like ‘I’ll never become a real Mage because I can never
Twynumbre: improve my Alchemy skills.’
Twynumbre: Now deep down I knew that thoughts like this were just not true.
Twynumbre: However when I believed them, I could not stop myself from getting angry.
Twynumbre: When I started to recognise these negative thoughts
Twynumbre: I found that I could more easily see them for what they are…
Twynumbre: Negative thoughts, not facts.
Twynumbre: When I began to question my own thoughts, my temper drastically improved over
Twynumbre: the course of a few weeks, and eventually I became top of my Alchemy class.
~ACTIVE
Twynumbre: Remember the story I told you earlier.
Twynumbre: Does Reba seem to be saying anything that is clearly irrational and negative?
Twynumbre: Try to think about the best outcome for everyone in this scenario.

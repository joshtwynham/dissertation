Arch-Mage: I want to tell you a story about when I was a young Mage like yourself.
Arch-Mage: Please follow me.
~PROLOGUE
Arch-Mage: It begins during my first year at Mage school. During Alchemy, where we mainly crafted potions
Arch-Mage: I found it particularly difficult to attain the same results as my peers.
Arch-Mage: This led to me getting extremely angry and smashing my half finished potions.
Arch-Mage: This happened far more often than I would like to admit…But I started to notice a pattern.
Arch-Mage: Just before I would get this feeling of anger the same thoughts popped into my head every time.
Arch-Mage: Thoughts like ‘I’ll never become a real Mage because I can never improve my Alchemy skills.’
Arch-Mage: Now deep down I knew that thoughts like this were just not true. However when I believed them,
Arch-Mage: I could not stop myself from getting angry. When I started to recognise these negative thoughts
Arch-Mage: I found that I could more easily see them for what they are…Negative thoughts, not facts.
Arch-Mage: When I began to question my own thoughts, my temper drastically improved over
Arch-Mage: the course of a few weeks, and eventually I became top of my Alchemy class.

Arch-Mage: Remember the story I told you earlier.
Arch-Mage: Does Reba seem to be saying anything that is clearly irrational and negative?
Arch-Mage: Try to think about the best outcome for everyone in this scenario.
